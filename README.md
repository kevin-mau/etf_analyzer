# *ETF Analyzer*
---
In this study we will analyze data from a database consisting of four different ETFs.  An ETF is an exchange-traded fund and is a popular 
investment vehicle because these funds contain many different stocks and therefore offer more diversification.  Investing in ETFs, also
called passive investing, allows the investor less risk due to the diversification of assets.  We will investigate the daily returns, the
average daily returns, and the cumulative returns of a fintech ETF that consists of four stocks: GOST, GS, PYPL, and SQ. 

Using the jupyter notebook, we will utilize SQL, Python and Voila library to analyze the performance of the ETF.  We will also include 
interactive visualizations.
